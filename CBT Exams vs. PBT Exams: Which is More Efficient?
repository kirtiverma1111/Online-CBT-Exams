CBT Exams vs. PBT Exams Which is More Efficient
With the advent of technology, the services of almost every industry have changed. Education is no different, and one of the most significant paradigm shifts in the assessment landscape, replacing Paper-Based Tests (PBT exams) with Computer-Based Tests (CBT exams). Both are aimed at assessing knowledge and skills, but the most difference can be found in efficiency, accessibility, and user experience. The main question is still this: CBT or PBT-which one is more efficient? Let’s get into the gist of it.

The Basics: What is CBT or PBT?
CBT (Computer-Based Tests): Exams are done in the digital space. The examinee interacts with computers or any other digital devices to take their test in a secured and controlled environment.

PBT (Paper-Based Tests): The use of the traditional pen and a paper way of preparing the exam by the subject. Students will have to answer an open question using pen or pencil on a specific answer space.

Both are good in their ways. Normally, efficiency is discussed either in terms of preparation, execution, scalability, and feedback.

Efficiency Showdown: Key Factors to Consider
Ease of Administration
CBT: Test administrators can provide such exams very quickly using pre-loaded software or online platforms. Scheduling can be done at their convenience. There is no need for person-to-person invigilation since the invigilator tools work automatically. 

PBT: Allotment, distribution, and the collection of papers consume time. Handling all of this also requires enough people to lead so that there are no hitches at the time of the exams. 

Winner: CBT: A complete, effective setup saves a lot of time and people.

Candidate Experience
CBT: Time-bound and interactive user interface offer help, including timers, navigations, zigzag, etc. even within a given examination (for instance, magnification for visually impaired students). The techie problem or unfamiliarity to the computer actually proves to be the major hindrance in access.

PBT: The simple act of writing on the paper makes many feel as at ease as with the majority of people who are still not tech-savvy. However, it takes time because the manual task can spell error in such acts as writing illegibly or placing the wrong answer sheet into multiple items.

Winner: CBT – The digitisation advantage enabled tests to be presented in a variety of ways to cater for everyone.

Accuracy and Speed of Evaluation
CBT: There are no long waiting times because the assesses can be evaluated at the touch of a button. The automated scoring system is much faster than manual marking. It saves time and minimises chances of error in human judgment and bias, which result in immediate feedback to the assesses.

PBT: Manual evaluation will make it too time-consuming and will also add to errors in mistake in course marking and question sheet. Checking per paper will take time; this all makes significant delays in the result. 

Winner: CBT – Quick and accurate: it can transform the evaluations now.

Scalability
CBT: A global organisation to a single-small classroom would still be able to conduct extensive tests through the use of a CBT platform, which requires no further change in infrastructure. The platform has remote proctor too, and this makes the tests possible anywhere.

PBT: To scale the test, the paper medium means a significant increase in overhead in the forms of printing, otherwise physical movement, and personnel cost, in large-scale operation.

Winner: CBT – Really simple to scale up globally as well. 

Environmental Impact
CBT: The examination does not use any kind of paper, print, or require huge transport; thus it is seen as somewhat more environmentally friendly.

PBT: The use of paper and ink may emit an enormous level of carbon emissions which then aggravate deforestation and other forms of waste. 

Winner: CBT – a sustainable choice in building a green future.

Challenges to Consider
CBT is not something that is clear despite apparent merits. Technical infrastructure, such as stable internet connectivity and availability of devices, is essential for the success of this kind of training. On the contrary, PBT is a last resort for the few who cannot access any technology and when it comes to inclusivity.

FAQs
What is the difference between CBT and PBT?
The difference between CBT and PBT is that during the computer-based exam, computers, tablets, or other devices are used. In this regard, much of the process is automated like scheduling, evaluation, and feedback. Paper-based tests involve using pen and paper as no marking is done through computers, and much of the job is about handling papers.

Why is CBT better than PBT from an efficiency perspective?
CBT is more efficient due to automated processes, quicker evaluations, and scalability. It reduces the time spent on administration, grading, and distribution, and allows for a more seamless user experience.

What are the benefits to the environment that CBT has?
Conducting CBT Exams Reduces the amount of paper used by PBT exams as it is computer based  which ultimately results in less carbon emissions and deforestation making it a more sustainable option compared to PBT, which requires significant amounts of paper, ink, and transport. CBT might not save the trees but it saves deforestation

Can CBT Exams facilities scalable globally?
As CBT does not require paper distribution or officials for invigilation, the answer to that is a yes. And moreover, global organizations can give right from first-class test-taking opportunities up to large-room testing with several high-performance and super fast computing systems.

Apart from this, Think Exam gives customised CBT solutions to streamline the assessment process, right from scheduling to result germination.

Can CBT be used for any type of test?
We must add, if reasonable, to explain further that no restrictions of any kind exist, proving it is most applicable. Further, a line should be drawn from Grade 2 to Ph.D., with a thin margin to be drawn on it to let us understand what is within the limits of applicability.
